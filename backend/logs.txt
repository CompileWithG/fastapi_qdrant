["Newton defines 'quantity of motion' (momentum) as the measure that arises conjointly from the velocity and quantity of matter, meaning it is the product of the mass and velocity of a body; he distinguishes this from 'force', which he defines as the power that produces changes in motion, noting, for example, that 'vis insita' is the innate force of matter to resist changes to its state, and that accelerative and motive forces are further mathematical distinctions related to changes in motion rather than the motion itself.", "Newton's three laws of motion are: (1) Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by impressed forces; (2) The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed; (3) To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction; in celestial mechanics, Newton used these laws to deduce gravitational forces from the motions of the moon and planets, to explain how these forces cause celestial bodies to follow specific orbits, and to show that Kepler's laws are consequences of his own—especially, that planetary motions and their perturbations can be accounted for by the interplay of inertia and gravity.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times) by arguing that if the force retaining the planet is always directed to the sun (as his laws dictate for a central force), then the resulting motion ensures that the radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out areas proportional to time, mathematically demonstrating that this is a necessary consequence of central forces and consistent with an inverse-square gravity law.", 'Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by mathematically showing that if the matter in two spheres is distributed similarly around their centers, the gravitational force between them is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers; he further proves that, when many small gravitating forces are summed across a whole mass (such as a planet), the total force likewise follows the inverse-square law, and planetary orbits under such a force are conic sections as observed.', "Newton argues that gravitational force must act universally on all masses because the observed phenomena—such as the moon's attraction to the earth, the tides resulting from the moon's pull, and the mutual attractions between all planets—show that every particle of matter attracts every other particle; he states that the evidence for universal gravitation is even stronger than for impenetrability, as shown by the proportional relationships observed and by applying his third law (action and reaction) to all parts and masses.", "Newton explains planetary perturbations as resulting from the gravitational influences of other planets, noting that while each planet's ideal orbit is an ellipse centered on the sun, the gravitational pull of other planets like Jupiter and Saturn introduces small, calculable errors or deviations; these perturbations are especially notable during conjunctions, but their effects can be mathematically corrected by considering the common center of gravity, and generally, the size of the perturbation depends on the relative masses and distances involved.", 'Newton used mathematical tools such as the method of fluxions (his version of derivatives and limits, a precursor to calculus) and infinite series, but preferred to present his results in geometrical, synthetic form rather than using the standard algebraic calculus notation; this preference stemmed from his belief in the clarity and rigor of classical geometry for foundational works, and he thought certain subjects were better handled without purely algebraic formulas.', 'Newton uses the concept of centripetal force as the force that acts towards a center, causing bodies, such as planets, to deviate from rectilinear motion and revolve in orbits; he formally defines centripetal force as the agency drawing or impelling bodies toward a point, and explains that this force (e.g., gravity) retains a planet in its orbit around the sun just as a sling holds a stone in circular motion, mathematically linking the necessary force to the observed curvature and velocity of the orbit.', "Newton handles motion in resisting media by analyzing the forces experienced by bodies moving through fluids like air or water, considering the density and resistance of the medium; he details how the resistance encountered depends on factors like the density and elasticity of the medium and the body's speed, and applies his third law to show that, for equal quantities of moving matter, the resistance and re-action will be equal, specifying conditions under which these resistive forces are calculated.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion by asserting that true (absolute) time and space exist independently of any external references or objects, while relative quantities are mere measures derived from positions or movements relative to other bodies; this distinction underpins his laws because the laws of motion apply universally in absolute space and time—regardless of the observer's frame of reference—and only by considering absolute (not merely relative) motion can one properly account for phenomena like inertia and centrifugal forces.", 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.']
