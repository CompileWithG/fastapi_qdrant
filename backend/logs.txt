["Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly, meaning it is given by the product of a body's mass and its velocity; this is distinct from 'force', as force relates to the power that changes this motion, where, for example, motive force is connected to the change in velocity (acceleration) and is what is required to produce motion, as clarified by the statement 'the quantity of motion arises from the celerity [velocity] drawn into the quantity of matter, and the motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter.'", 'According to Newton, the three laws of motion are: (1) every body perseveres in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change by impressed forces, (2) the change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which that force is impressed, and (3) to every action there is always opposed an equal reaction; these laws are foundational in celestial mechanics, as Newton applies them to explain that the forces observed in the motions of the moon, planets, and comets can be derived mathematically from the same laws, establishing, for example, that the gravitational attraction decreases with the square of the distance and governs the orbits of celestial bodies as shown in the motion of the moon and the planets around the sun.']

["Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times) by showing, from Kepler's observation that the areas described by a planet's radius vector are proportional to time, that the force holding the planet in its orbit must always be directed towards the sun; this follows from Newton's laws of motion, which, when applied to orbital motion, require that a central force (i.e., always pulling towards the sun) will result in the radius vector sweeping out equal areas in equal times, thus mathematically demonstrating Kepler's law based on physical principles.", 'Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by considering spheres whose matter is similar at all distances from the center, showing that the total gravitational attraction arises from the sum of the forces from all parts of the spheres; he then proves, using propositions and theorems (e.g., Proposition VIII, Theorem VIII), that the total force between spheres decreases in proportion to the square of their separation, and, from the motions of celestial bodies and their paths being conic sections, that only an inverse-square law of force can account for observed planetary motions.', "Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally is that observations such as the mutual gravitation between the Earth and Moon, the planets gravitating towards one another, and similar evidence from the behavior of comets and celestial bodies, require us to accept that every particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and furthermore, that the gravitational attraction is proportional to the amount of matter, which is supported by the principle that all parts of every planet gravitate in proportion to their mass and by the law of action and reaction."]

["Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets by showing that all planets exert mutual gravitational attractions on one another, which cause small disturbances or perturbations in their motions; while these forces, according to Newton, are generally very small and can often be neglected, exceptions occur in closely interacting systems like Jupiter and Saturn, where the perturbations are measurable but still minor, and the resultant errors in the planets' motions are minimized by considering motions about their common center of gravity, with the greatest perturbations rarely exceeding two minutes yearly, except notably in the Earth-Moon system.", "Newton used mathematical tools in the Principia that were direct precursors to calculus, such as his method of fluxions (which corresponds to derivatives and rates of change), but he did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred geometric methods and classical synthesis for rigor and clarity, often expressing results without algebraic or algorithmic symbols, and though he had developed his fluxional notation years earlier, he deliberately avoided it in the Principia due to both his personal preference for geometrical arguments and perhaps to avoid controversy about priority with Leibniz, as noted in the document's references to his condemnation of treating geometry with algebraic calculations and his naming of Algebra as 'Universal Arithmetic.'", 'Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by defining a centripetal force as one that draws or impels bodies towards a center, such as gravity toward the earth or sun, and asserting that this force acts to continuously deflect a planet or body from its natural straight-line path into a curved orbit; he provides mathematical definitions and propositions showing that a body revolves in an orbit under the influence of a centripetal force directed to a center, with the magnitude of this force determining the precise path (such as an ellipse), so that the ongoing action of the centripetal force explains the observed motion of planets and other celestial bodies.']
