["Newton defines 'quantity of motion' (momentum) as the measure that arises conjointly from the velocity and quantity of matter, meaning it is the product of the mass and velocity of a body; he distinguishes this from 'force', which he defines as the power that produces changes in motion, noting, for example, that 'vis insita' is the innate force of matter to resist changes to its state, and that accelerative and motive forces are further mathematical distinctions related to changes in motion rather than the motion itself.", "Newton's three laws of motion are: (1) Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by impressed forces; (2) The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed; (3) To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction; in celestial mechanics, Newton used these laws to deduce gravitational forces from the motions of the moon and planets, to explain how these forces cause celestial bodies to follow specific orbits, and to show that Kepler's laws are consequences of his ownâ€”especially, that planetary motions and their perturbations can be accounted for by the interplay of inertia and gravity.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times) by arguing that if the force retaining the planet is always directed to the sun (as his laws dictate for a central force), then the resulting motion ensures that the radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out areas proportional to time, mathematically demonstrating that this is a necessary consequence of central forces and consistent with an inverse-square gravity law.", 'Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by mathematically showing that if the matter in two spheres is distributed similarly around their centers, the gravitational force between them is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers; he further proves that, when many small gravitating forces are summed across a whole mass (such as a planet), the total force likewise follows the inverse-square law, and planetary orbits under such a force are conic sections as observed.', "Newton argues that gravitational force must act universally on all masses because the observed phenomenaâ€”such as the moon's attraction to the earth, the tides resulting from the moon's pull, and the mutual attractions between all planetsâ€”show that every particle of matter attracts every other particle; he states that the evidence for universal gravitation is even stronger than for impenetrability, as shown by the proportional relationships observed and by applying his third law (action and reaction) to all parts and masses.", "Newton explains planetary perturbations as resulting from the gravitational influences of other planets, noting that while each planet's ideal orbit is an ellipse centered on the sun, the gravitational pull of other planets like Jupiter and Saturn introduces small, calculable errors or deviations; these perturbations are especially notable during conjunctions, but their effects can be mathematically corrected by considering the common center of gravity, and generally, the size of the perturbation depends on the relative masses and distances involved.", 'Newton used mathematical tools such as the method of fluxions (his version of derivatives and limits, a precursor to calculus) and infinite series, but preferred to present his results in geometrical, synthetic form rather than using the standard algebraic calculus notation; this preference stemmed from his belief in the clarity and rigor of classical geometry for foundational works, and he thought certain subjects were better handled without purely algebraic formulas.', 'Newton uses the concept of centripetal force as the force that acts towards a center, causing bodies, such as planets, to deviate from rectilinear motion and revolve in orbits; he formally defines centripetal force as the agency drawing or impelling bodies toward a point, and explains that this force (e.g., gravity) retains a planet in its orbit around the sun just as a sling holds a stone in circular motion, mathematically linking the necessary force to the observed curvature and velocity of the orbit.', "Newton handles motion in resisting media by analyzing the forces experienced by bodies moving through fluids like air or water, considering the density and resistance of the medium; he details how the resistance encountered depends on factors like the density and elasticity of the medium and the body's speed, and applies his third law to show that, for equal quantities of moving matter, the resistance and re-action will be equal, specifying conditions under which these resistive forces are calculated.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion by asserting that true (absolute) time and space exist independently of any external references or objects, while relative quantities are mere measures derived from positions or movements relative to other bodies; this distinction underpins his laws because the laws of motion apply universally in absolute space and timeâ€”regardless of the observer's frame of referenceâ€”and only by considering absolute (not merely relative) motion can one properly account for phenomena like inertia and centrifugal forces.", 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.']

['Based on the context, if you have already raised a claim with HDFC for Rs 200,000 and it has been approved, whether you can raise the remaining Rs 50,000 with another insurer depends on whether you have a separate insurance policy with the company you are addressing, as the document discusses admissible hospitalization expenses, time limits, and sublimits for reimbursements but does not prohibit or explicitly allow claims for remaining amounts with another insurer; however, for any reimbursement claim, you would need to submit all required documents and stay within the defined limits such as room rent and ICU charges, and coordination of benefits between insurers is not detailed in the provided context, so the ability to claim the remaining Rs 50,000 would depend on your policy terms and is not directly specified in this document.']

["Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter together—meaning it is the product of a body's mass and velocity—while 'force' (specifically vis insita) refers to the innate power of matter to resist changes to its state or to alter motion, and so 'quantity of motion' describes the existing state of a moving body, whereas 'force' describes what causes changes to that state (as shown in the context: 'The quantity of motion arises from the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter: and the motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter').", "Newton's three laws of motion are: (1) Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon; (2) The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed, and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed (though not precisely quoted in context, this is the standard statement of Newton's second law and is implied in the document); and (3) To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction (again, implied in context and acknowledged in reference to Law III); these laws apply in celestial mechanics by allowing Newton to derive the motions of the planets, the moon, and comets under the influence of gravity as mathematically demonstrated from celestial phenomena.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law, which states that areas swept out by a planet in its orbit are proportional to times, by showing that this is a consequence of a force always directed toward the sun (a central force), as inferred from Kepler's law of areas; from the elliptical nature of orbits, he further deduced that the force varies inversely as the square of the distance, mathematically proving that such a force results in orbits where equal areas are swept in equal times.", 'Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing, in Propositions VIII and related theorems, that the mutual weight (force of attraction) of two spheres is as the reciprocal of the square of the distance between their centers, supported by his analysis that the force towards each part of a planet varies in the same reciprocal manner and that such a force causes bodies to move in elliptical orbits as observed.', 'Newton argues that gravitational force must act on all masses universally because all observed bodies—planets, moons, comets, and even the sea—demonstrate mutual attraction proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distances, making it necessary to universally allow that all bodies possess mutual gravitation, and further, the argument from empirical appearances is even stronger for universal gravitation than for other properties like impenetrability.', 'Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets by calculating the comparative gravitational forces exerted by the sun and the planets (e.g., Jupiter and Saturn), showing that the difference in these forces leads to small errors (perturbations) in the orbits, but that these are generally minor except for certain cases, such as the notable disturbance of the earth’s orbit by the moon, and quantifies these perturbations by comparing the relevant forces acting on the planets.', 'Newton used the method of fluxions—an early form of the calculus—and infinite series expansions as precursors to calculus in the Principia, but he did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred a geometrical method for clarity and rigor, believing algebraic methods should not encroach unnecessarily on geometrical reasoning, as reflected in his mature opinion and the contemporary mathematical culture.', "Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by defining it as the force that continually draws or impels a body toward a fixed center (such as the sun or the center of the earth), causing it to deviate from straight-line motion and follow a curve, such as an ellipse, and he demonstrates that it is the balance of this centripetal force with the body's inertial tendency that keeps bodies in stable orbits.", "Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by analyzing the density and resistance of these mediums and showing mathematically how particles moving through them are resisted according to the medium's properties; he discusses how resistance does not depend on the detailed nature of the medium's particles but rather on the density and the interactions between body and medium, accounting for hydrostatics and drag in the analysis.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in that absolute space and time exist independently and are the true framework within which true motion and rest occur, whereas relative space and time are measures based on the positions and motions of objects relative to one another or to reference frames, and this distinction underlies the universality of his laws by allowing clear definitions of motion unaffected by subjective frames of reference (e.g., a sailor walking in a ship has different relative and absolute motions).", 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.']

["Based on the context provided, the best-known and most influential theorem Newton proposed is his development of the mathematical principles for the system of the world, particularly expressed in the form of Propositions in his 'Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy', where he rigorously demonstrated the consequences of his laws of motion and gravitation, and preferred a mathematical over a popular method to present foundational theorems such as those concerning ultimate ratios, the properties of curve lines, and the relationships among triangles and areas as in Lemma IX; these mathematical structures underlie his laws of universal gravitation, widely considered his most important theorem."]

["Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly (i.e., mass times velocity), meaning that in a body with twice the quantity of matter and equal velocity, the motion is doubled, distinguishing it from 'force', which refers to the action that alters motion, such as vis insita (innate force) or forces that produce or change motion, rather than motion itself.", "Newton's three laws of motion are: 1) Every body perseveres in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change by impressed forces, 2) The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of that force, and 3) To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction; in celestial mechanics, these laws explain how planetary bodies continue in their orbits and how gravitational forces between them produce the observed motions described mathematicially in Principia.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law—that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times—by showing that if a planet is always drawn toward the sun by a force directed to the sun, then the areas described by the line connecting the planet to the sun are proportional to the times, thus mathematically demonstrating that the force causing planetary motion is centripetal and always points toward the sun.", 'Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing, in Proposition VIII, that the weight of either of two mutually gravitating spheres is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers, and that the attractive force of gravity, when analyzed for all parts of each mass, follows this inverse square law, validated further by the motions of planets and projectiles under such a force.', 'Newton argues that gravitational force must act on all masses universally by pointing out that every particle of matter is attracted to every other according to the inverse square law, deduced from the motion of the moon, the tides, and planetary interactions, and confirmed by the observed mutual gravitation among the earth, moon, sun, planets, and comets, thus concluding that all bodies possess a principle of mutual gravitation proportional to their mass.', 'Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets by calculating the differences in gravitational forces (such as that of the sun and Jupiter on Saturn) and showing that the resulting perturbations, though typically small, cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, with the largest perturbations arising from the moon on the earth and the conjunctions of massive planets like Jupiter and Saturn, and that the errors in mean motion are minor but quantifiable.', 'Newton used the method of fluxions (his version of early calculus), as well as geometrical methods and infinite series, but chose not to use standard calculus notation because he preferred the geometric method for clarity and rigour, and considered algebraic or algorithmic formulas less appropriate for the exposition of mathematical physics in the Principia, even though the method of fluxions and the differential method (later called calculus) were essentially the same, differing mainly in notation.', 'Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by defining it as a force by which bodies are drawn or impelled toward a point as a center (such as gravity with respect to the sun or earth), and demonstrates mathematically how such a force, acting continuously to deflect a body from rectilinear motion, results in the body revolving in an orbit around the center of force, with quantities of the force considered as absolute, accelerative, or motive.', 'Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by analyzing how the resistance offered by the medium (depending on its density and properties) affects the motion of bodies, explaining that bodies striking particles of the medium transfer equal quantities of motion, leading to equal resistance (by the 3rd law), and discusses the principles of density, compression, and hydrostatics as they apply to motions in fluids and the resulting resistance.', "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in that absolute time and space exist independently and mathematically, unaffected by external factors, whereas relative time and space are measured by their relation to observable objects, and he argues this distinction is necessary to prevent confusion in the application of his laws of motion, since true motion is determined with reference to absolute space and time, supporting the rigor and universality of his physical laws."]

['Expenses for domiciliary treatment of arthritis at home would NOT be covered—even if the doctor declares it was medically required and hospital beds were unavailable—because the policy explicitly excludes claims for arthritis, gout, and rheumatism under the domiciliary hospitalisation exclusions, as listed in clause iii.b.', "The claim will cover the cost of the prosthetic device implanted during the hip replacement surgery as it is payable under surgical/medical appliances and orthopaedic implants, but the walker and lumbar belt post-discharge are not payable since 'walking aids charges' and 'crutches, belts... and any medical equipment subsequently used at home except when they form part of room expenses' are excluded; lumbar belt is only payable for lumbar spine surgery, not hip surgery.", "The child's claim for dental surgery after an accident is admissible if dental expenses cover was opted for, the child is a dependent above 18 but under 26, unmarried, unemployed, and covered concurrent with the parent as per eligibility, and since it is not for orthodontic treatment (which restricts coverage to children below 18), accident-related dental surgery is not excluded; claims must be submitted with the claim form, invoices, prescription, and reports to the TPA or company office.", 'Expenses for Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery are covered but restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI) as per IRDAI regulations for modern treatments, while ICU charges in a city with over 1 million population are covered up to the category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance or actuals, whichever is less, meaning both are subject to their respective sub-limits and policy schedule amounts.', 'A newly-adopted 3-year-old child may be added as a dependent during the policy period if the insurer accepts the application, receives pro-rata additional premium, and issues an endorsement confirming the addition; however, cover may be refused if the child does not meet eligibility criteria (e.g., parent not concurrently covered, not notified within the timeline, or other exclusion/underwriting grounds as per policy schedule).', "For the day care cataract procedure, claim notification should be made immediately after discharge (for cashless) or within 15 days of discharge (for reimbursement), with required documents including claim form, invoices, doctor's certificate, medical reports; if complications require 5 days inpatient care in a non-network hospital, the same claim process applies, and post-hospitalization claims must be submitted within 15 days of completion of treatment—both claims need supporting documents for each hospitalisation.", "The newborn's treatment expenses within 24 hours of life are eligible if the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted, provided the newborn was intended to be added and premium is paid with written notification by the end of the following month; however, eligibility is still subject to the standard newborn acceptance procedure, benefit cover terms, and specific exclusions such as for infertility or surrogacy.", "A prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist are not sufficient for an inpatient psychiatric claim because eligible diagnosis and treatment must come from a registered psychiatrist or specialist as per the definition, and the claim documents must include an attending medical practitioner's or surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis and procedures performed; a clinical psychologist’s certification alone does not meet claim document requirements.", "According to the annexure listing non-medical expenses, ECG electrodes and gloves are typically excluded ('for complete list of non-medical expenses, please refer to the Annexure I “Non-Medical Expenses”'), meaning that such consumables are not admissible unless they form part of allowable medical consumables prescribed and not otherwise excluded, and specific items like gloves and ECG electrodes are often specifically listed as non-payable.", 'Both pre-hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission and post-hospitalisation expenses incurred 20 days after discharge can be claimed, provided they are for the same illness, the in-patient hospitalisation claim is admissible, and both are within the pre-defined days and amount limits specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, as per the definitions in clauses 36 and 4.', 'Coverage for a dependent child who turns 27 during the policy year ceases at the time the child ceases to be a dependent, which is when they attain age 27; unless specifically agreed for coverage till policy period end, deletion happens from the date the dependent ceases to meet eligibility (i.e., on their 27th birthday), and premium may be refunded on a pro-rata basis if no claims are outstanding.', 'If the insured opts for a private room exceeding the allowed room rent limit, all associated medical expenses—including diagnostics and specialist fees—will be reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rent to the actual room rent (i.e., proportionate clause applies), as stated in Note 1 under Clause III.A.1.A.', 'If a claim is partly rejected for missing documentation and the insured resubmits within 10 days, the insurer must reassess and communicate a decision within 15 days of receiving the final documents; if finally rejected, the insured can represent for reconsideration within 15 days, and further recourse is available per the grievance procedure—timelines for handling claims and delays are governed by company policy and regulatory requirements.', "The claim is eligible as a day care treatment because minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia for less than 24 hours meets the 'Day Care Treatment' definition if, due to technological advancement, such procedures now require less than 24 hours but would otherwise have needed hospitalisation over 24 hours; treatment taken as an out-patient is not eligible.", 'For towns with less than 1 million population, the hospital must have at least 10 inpatient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily records; in metropolitan or larger towns (population over 1 million), at least 15 inpatient beds are required, making the main difference the minimum bed count.', 'The new employee is eligible for mid-policy addition as a group member, the spouse as the employee’s dependent if the relationship is covered, and the sibling if unmarried/unemployed and under 26 years; required documents generally include application for cover, KYC, supportive relationship/dependency proof, payment of pro-rata additional premium, and the insurer’s endorsement confirming the addition.', 'Robotic surgery for cancer is covered up to the specific sub-limit listed in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, regardless of whether performed as day care or inpatient; for malignancies and CNS diseases, the same sub-limit applies for both settings, and other diseases have their own specified limits as indicated in the relevant schedule.', "For air ambulance evacuation following an accident, immediate notification to the insurer and pre-authorization are mandatory, with medical necessity determined by specialists in association with the emergency assistance provider, followed by claims assessment which requires submission of the air ambulance ticket (from a registered provider), certificate of medical necessity, treating doctor's reports, and supporting hospitalisation documents.", 'If an insured ported from another policy with prior continuous coverage, the waiting period for specific illnesses (like knee replacement for osteoarthritis) will be reduced by the prior coverage period as per IRDAI portability norms, meaning only the remaining waiting period—if any—applies, and in case of a longer pre-existing/exclusion period, the greater waiting period governs.', 'An imported medication prescribed as part of inpatient treatment is only covered if it is for medically necessary treatment that conforms to standards accepted in Indian medical community or international practice and is not unproven or experimental; if the medication does not meet these criteria, the expense is not payable.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.', 'The document does not specify.']
