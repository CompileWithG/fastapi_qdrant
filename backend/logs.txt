['What is the ideal spark plug gap recommeded', 'Does this comes in tubeless tyre version', 'Is it compulsoury to have a disc brake', 'Can I put thums up instead of oil', 'Give me JS code to generate a random number between 1 and 100']

['The ideal spark plug gap recommended is 0.8-0.9 mm using a wire-type feeler gauge, as indicated multiple times in the context and emphasized as important for proper engine operation.', 'The vehicle comes with tubeless tyres as standard; both the front 80/100-18 47P and the rear 90/90-18 51P tyres are specified as tubeless in the document, and it is also stated that you should only use tubeless tyres because the rims are designed specifically for them.', 'It is not compulsory to have a disc brake, as the document references both disc and non-disc (drum/rear brake) variants and provides maintenance instructions for both types, implying that the vehicle can be equipped with either system.', 'You cannot use Thums Up or any substance other than the recommended engine oil in the engine, as the manual strictly specifies to use Hero genuine engine oil or the recommended grade SAE 10W 30 SL Grade (JASO MA2) and warns that insufficient, excessive, or unsuitable oil can cause serious engine damage.', 'You can generate a random number between 1 and 100 in JavaScript using the code Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1, which applies a standard method for inclusive random number generation within that range.']
