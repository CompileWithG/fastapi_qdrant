    "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?": "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as a measure that arises from the velocity and quantity of matter combined, meaning it is the product of an object's mass and velocity; this is distinct from 'force,' which Newton further subdivides, for example, as 'motive force' arising from accelerative force and mass, indicating that while quantity of motion (momentum) is about the state of movement an object possesses, force refers to the influence that causes a change in that motion, as seen when he says 'the quantity of motion arises from the celerity [velocity] drawn into the quantity of matter' and 'the motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter.'",
    "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?": "Newton's three laws of motion, as presented, are: First, every body perseveres in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it; second and third laws are not quoted directly in the provided context, but the first law is applied in celestial mechanics by explaining that celestial bodies like planets and comets persist in their motions except as influenced by forces such as gravity, and Newton uses these principles, especially in the third book, to derive the gravitational forces acting in celestial systems and to demonstrate the motions of the planets, comets, and moons based on these laws, particularly showing that gravitation acts according to the inverse square of the distance between masses.",
    "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?": "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law\u2014that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times\u2014by showing that if a body is acted upon by a force always directed toward a center (as the sun), the area swept out by its radius vector is proportional to time, which means the force must be centripetal; from Kepler's First Law (elliptical orbits), he infers the centripetal force causes the motion in an ellipse and through mathematical propositions demonstrates that such a force must vary inversely as the square of the distance, thus connecting Kepler\u2019s law with his own laws of motion and gravitation.",
    "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?": "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by considering the mutual attraction of two spheres where the force between them is compounded of the forces toward all their parts, each following an inverse square law; he references multiple propositions and corollaries in the Principia to show that planetary and satellite motions only occur correctly if the central force decreases with the square of the distance, matching observations such as those encoded in Kepler\u2019s laws.",
    "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?": "Newton argues that gravitational force must act on all masses universally by reasoning from the observed motions of the moon, sea, planets, and comets\u2014all mutually attracting each other in proportion to their quantities of matter\u2014that all bodies possess a principle of mutual gravitation; he further justifies this by pointing out that the gravity of a planet is proportional to its matter and, by action-reaction (his Third Law), each part attracts and is attracted, indicating the universality of gravity even down to the least particle.",
    "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?": "Newton explains that the perturbation of planetary orbits is due to the mutual gravitational influences of other planets; while these influences are usually very small and often negligible except in cases like Jupiter and Saturn or the Earth's orbit disturbed by the moon, he shows mathematically that such perturbations can be analyzed by comparing the forces of gravity between planets, and the errors in planetary motion can usually be accounted for or corrected by considering the common center of gravity or focusing on the mean motion.",
    "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?": "In Principia, Newton used geometrical arguments and the method of fluxions (his form of early calculus), but did not use standard calculus notation; this was partly because he preferred the clarity of geometric methods for demonstrating mathematical truths, censuring the use of purely algebraic or algorithmic formulae in geometric subjects, and also because at the time, the algorithmic notation of calculus (like Leibniz's 'd' notation) was not yet widely established or universally accepted, so he chose the more rigorous and traditionally respected geometric approach.",
    "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?": "Newton explains orbital motion by introducing the concept of centripetal force, which he defines as the force that draws bodies toward a point as a center; for instance, gravity serves as the centripetal force drawing bodies toward Earth's center, and he generalizes this for any planet or orbiting body, stating that for an object to stay in a given orbit with a given velocity, a force of exact magnitude (the centripetal force) is needed to pull it continually away from its natural straight-line path, causing it to curve around the center, and he formalizes the mathematical relations required for such forces to result in the observed orbits.",
    "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?": "Newton addresses motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by analyzing the nature of fluids, their density, and compression, and by discussing how resistance arises from the motion of a body through the medium, showing that resistance is related to the motion excited in the fluid's particles and the density of the medium rather than simply the compression, and he establishes that the resistance cannot be less in a subtler medium like aether in proportion to its density than in denser media like air or water, thus requiring additional force against resistance to sustain motion.",
    "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?": "Newton distinguishes absolute space and time from relative motion by stating that absolute, true, and mathematical time flows equably without regard to anything external, while relative, apparent time is measured by sensible means (like clocks) and may not be entirely accurate, similarly absolute space remains always the same and immovable, while relative space is a measure determined by its relation to other bodies; he notes that true motion depends on real forces acting upon bodies in immovable space, whereas relative motion may arise from changes in the reference frame (like a moving ship), and this distinction supports his laws by providing an invariant background (absolute space and time) where true causes of motion and changes can be distinctly analyzed.",
    "Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?": "According to the document, Isaac Newton's grandfather was John Newton, Lord of the Manor of Woolsthorpe, as stated on the commemorative tablet in the room where Isaac was born.",
    "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?": "The document identifies Newton's father-in-law as Mr. Smith but provides no further information about other ancestors or descendants beyond his grandfather John Newton, so apart from his grandfather, no other descent of Isaac Newton is specified."

    "If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?": "If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, these expenses would NOT be covered under the policy, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required, because the document explicitly states that 'We shall not be liable to pay for any claim in connection with ... Arthritis, gout and rheumatism' under domiciliary hospitalization exclusions; thus, home treatment for arthritis is excluded regardless of medical necessity or hospital bed availability.",
    "A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?": "The cost of the prosthetic device implanted during the hip replacement surgery is payable, as prosthetic devices implanted during a surgical procedure are covered; however, the cost of the walker is not payable as walking aids are explicitly listed as non-payable items, and the lumbar belt is only payable if the patient has undergone surgery of the lumbar spine, not hip replacement\u2014so in this scenario, the walker and lumbar belt are not payable according to the policy's non-medical expenses list and itemised exclusions.",
    "An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?": "If the insured's child is above 18 but under 26, unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, they are eligible for coverage if at least one parent is covered concurrently, and dental surgery after an accident is admissible since dental treatment exclusions do not apply to accidental injuries and the specific waiting period for dental procedures is waived for accident-related claims; the process requires timely claim notification, submission of the claim form, invoices, doctor's prescription, and reports to the insurer or TPA, who will assess and settle or repudiate the claim within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document.",
    "If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?": "For a hospitalisation involving both Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery and ICU care in a city with a population over 1 million, expenses for IONM are covered but restricted to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance for modern treatments (frequently capped at 50% of Sum Insured); ICU charges, including nursing and designated support, are payable up to the ICU rent sub-limit of 4% of the Sum Insured per day or the actual incurred, whichever is less, as specified in the policy schedule, with all such costs subject to proportionate deductions if a higher room category was utilised.",
    "A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?": "To add a newly-adopted 3-year-old child as a dependent, the policyholder must submit a request and pay the additional premium on a pro-rata basis, and coverage is provided as long as either parent is concurrently covered and the application is accepted by the insurer, but the insurer may refuse cover if the child is not within the eligible relationship or age group, the group size requirement is not met, premium is not paid, notification is delayed beyond the required period, or ineligibility as detailed in the eligibility and addition/deletion clauses occurs\u2014assessment and endorsement from the insurer is required for confirmation.",
    "If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.": "For a day care cataract procedure, notify the insurer/TPA immediately and submit the claim form, ID proof, doctor's certificate, bills, and reports within 15 days of discharge for reimbursement if cashless is not availed; for post-procedure complications requiring 5 days' inpatient care in a non-network hospital, notify the insurer within 24 hours of admission (or per policy terms), and submit all original documents including treatment papers, discharge summaries, and receipts within 15 days of discharge for the second admission, and any related post-hospitalisation claims must be filed within 15 days of completing the covered post-hospitalisation period, as specified in the document.",
    "An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?": "Eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses exists only if the newborn is formally added as an Insured Person by written notification within the prescribed time ('before the last day of the month following birth'), required premium paid, and endorsement issued, according to the terms under 'New Born Babies will be accepted for cover...'; since the newborn died within 24 hours and intensive care was required, expenses will only be covered if these steps were completed before the treatment, otherwise, the newborn is not eligible, as coverage for the baby from Day 1 is conditional on compliance with addition and premium payment procedures and the benefit is further limited to the Family Sum Insured and subject to limitations and exclusions outlined for newborns and maternity.",
    "If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.": "No, a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment supported only by a general practitioner's prescription and a discharge summary certified by a Clinical Psychologist is insufficient, because the policy requires that a 'Mental Healthcare Professional' includes a psychiatrist, a registered professional with the State Authority, or specifically qualified alternative medicine professionals, including Clinical Psychologists, but for claim submissions, a certificate/diagnosis and prescriptions must be from the attending medical practitioner, which typically means a psychiatrist or a psychiatrist-designated specialist, and supporting documents must meet the 'attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate' criteria as outlined under document requirements; thus, unless the Clinical Psychologist qualifies as the attending medical practitioner per policy or state law, the claim may be denied for lack of eligible documentation.",
    "A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?": "Referencing the policy annexures, expenses for ECG electrodes and gloves are classified as non-admissible items under the 'Non-Medical Expenses' list (Annexure I), which specifically excludes such consumables from individual reimbursement even during oral chemotherapy sessions, unless they are subsumed within a broader covered cost (such as room or general treatment cost in a package), so neither ECG electrodes nor gloves are directly reimbursable as standalone claims.",
    "A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.": "The insured person may claim pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred up to the pre-defined number of days before admission (here, 18 days before admission) and post-hospitalization expenses incurred for diagnostics and pharmacy (here, 20 days after discharge), provided these are for the same condition as the covered inpatient hospitalization, and are within the day limits and amount specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance; the settlement of pre-/post-hospitalization claims is contingent upon acceptance of the main hospitalization claim, as per policy definitions under 'Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses' and 'Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover'.",
    "If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?": "If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period, their coverage as a dependent ends when they cease to be eligible, i.e., at their 27th birthday, regardless of the premium being paid at the start of the year; per the policy, dependent children are covered only up to age 26, so coverage terminates at age 27, and the child should be deleted from the policy as of that date, with premium refund calculated on a pro-rata basis subject to no claims being paid or outstanding for the dependent.",
    "A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?": "In the event that the insured person selects a hospital room with rent exceeding the policy's allowed limit, all associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, are reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rent to the actual room rent charged, as per the Proportionate Clause in Note 1 of Clause III.A.1.A; this means that if the room rent is above the eligible limit, expenses like doctors\u2019 fees, investigation charges, and other admissible items are subject to proportional reduction.",
    "Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.": "If a claim is partly rejected due to missing documentation and the insured resubmits documents after 10 days, the insurer must settle or reject the claim within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document; if the final claim is rejected, the insured may represent for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the decision, and any further grievances can be escalated through the company\u2019s redressal channels listed in section 14, which includes website, toll-free number, email, and postal address.",
    "An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.": "A hospitalization for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia is eligible for claim if the procedure is classified as Day Care Treatment, which is defined as medical or surgical treatment undertaken in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement but which would have otherwise required more than 24 hours of hospitalization; standard out-patient treatments remain excluded.",
    "When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?": "In towns with a population less than 1 million, a hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records; in metropolitan and other larger areas (population above 1 million), the minimum in-patient bed requirement increases to 15, while other criteria remain the same.",
    "A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy.
