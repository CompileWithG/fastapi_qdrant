    "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?": "Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by analyzing the resistance experienced by bodies moving through these media, explaining that resistance is proportionate to the motion given to the fluid by the projectile; this resistance depends on the density of the medium, and Newton uses his Third Law to show that bodies of equal density experience equal resistance regardless of the nature of the particles in the medium, as detailed across multiple sections, including discussions of hydrostatics and the propagation of motion in fluids.",
    "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?": "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in that he distinguishes absolute, true, and mathematical time and space as existing independently of any external reference or observable objects, whereas relative motion is determined by the position of bodies in relation to one another; this distinction supports his laws by providing a fixed, universal frame in which forces are defined and act, as demonstrated by his example of a ship and a sailor moving within it, where the real, absolute motion is in immovable space, not just relative to immediate surroundings.",
    "Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?": "Isaac Newton's grandfather was John Newton, as indicated by the inscription stating, 'Sir Isaac Newton, son of John Newton, Lord of the Manor of Woolsthorpe, was born in this room, on the 25th of December, 1642.'",
    "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?": "The only other descent known from Isaac Newton in the document relates to his father's death and his mother\u2019s remarriage to Mr. Smith, making Mr. Smith his stepfather or father-in-law, but there is no mention of further direct ancestry or extended descent apart from his grandfather.",
    "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?": "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure resulting from the velocity multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass); in other words, it is what we call momentum (mass times velocity), and it is distinct from 'force', which in Newtonian mechanics relates to the cause of change in motion\u2014force produces acceleration according to the laws of motion, while quantity of motion is a property describing the state of motion itself ('the quantity of motion arises from the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter', whereas 'the motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter').",
    "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?": "Newton's three laws of motion are: (1) Every body perseveres in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it; (2) The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place in the direction of the straight line in which that force is impressed; (3) To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction; these laws are applied in celestial mechanics by using them, in conjunction with the principle of universal gravitation (that every particle attracts every other with a force inversely proportional to the square of their distance), to mathematically derive and explain the motions of planets, comets, and other celestial bodies as conic sections and to demonstrate the reality of gravitational attraction as the underlying force.",
    "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?": "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law\u2014the law of equal areas in equal times\u2014by showing that if the force retaining the planet in its orbit is always directed to the sun (a central force), then, according to his laws of motion and gravitation, the planet's radius vector will sweep out equal areas in equal times, thus providing a dynamical foundation for Kepler's empirical observation; this follows because a central force results in the conservation of angular momentum, ensuring that the area law must hold.",
    "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?": "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by first showing that the force acting on a body towards each part of a sphere is reciprocally as the square of their distances, then proving that the total force between two spheres with uniform distribution of mass is also reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers, and finally confirming through mathematical reasoning and observations (such as planetary orbits and projectiles moving in ellipses when under such a force) that only a force with this law would result in the observed motions, as expressed in 'the weight of either sphere towards the other will be reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centres'.",
    "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?": "Newton's argument for the universal action of gravitational force is based on observations and logical deduction: since the moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, planets towards each other, and comets towards the sun, it follows that all bodies have mutual gravitation, supported by the fact that the force operates according to the inverse square law and acts proportionally to the quantity of matter in each body; he further argues that, since the evidence for universal gravitation is even stronger than for properties like impenetrability (which can't be directly observed in celestial bodies), we must 'universally allow that all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation,' as all parts of any object gravitate towards any other in exact proportion to their mass, and experiments (such as those with pendulums) confirm this relationship.",
    "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?": "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets by noting that all planets mutually gravitate towards each other according to the same inverse square law, resulting in slight disturbances or deviations from their ideal elliptical paths around the sun; for example, Jupiter and Saturn exert measurable, though small, gravitational influences on each other's orbits, causing small errors or changes in their motions (with Jupiter's effect on Saturn being significant among planets, but still much weaker than the sun's), while most other mutual planetary effects are so small they can generally be neglected, except in cases like the significant perturbation of Earth's orbit by the moon.",
    "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?": "In Principia, Newton employed mathematical tools such as geometric arguments, infinitesimal ratios, and his own method of fluxions (an early form of calculus), but he avoided standard calculus notation because he preferred the rigor and clarity of the geometrical method for presentation, explicitly criticizing the use of algebraic calculations for geometrical problems and expressing a mature preference for classical geometry over algorithmic or purely analytical formulae, as reflected in his avoidance of Leibniz's notation and his own choice to call his algebra 'Universal Arithmetic' rather than geometry.",
    "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?": "Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by defining it as a force that draws or impels bodies towards a point as a center, such as gravity drawing planets toward the sun or objects to the earth, and mathematically demonstrates that if a body is acted on by a centripetal force directed toward a center, its motion will deviate from a straight line to follow a curved path or orbit; he derives relationships showing that the centripetal force needed to keep a body in a given orbit with a given velocity can be calculated, and for planetary and celestial orbits, this force acts according to precise laws (including the inverse square law), thus accounting for the observed trajectories of planets and moons."

    "An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?": "A dependent child above 18 and under 26, who is unmarried, unemployed, and covered as a dependent is eligible for a dental surgery claim only if the dental treatment is required due to an accident and necessitates hospitalisation; elective or routine dental procedures remain excluded, so the claim is admissible if the surgery is post-accident and involves inpatient care, and the process requires submission of the claim form, invoices, prescription from the treating doctor, and related reports to the insurer within the defined timelines.",
    "If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?": "If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery and also requires ICU care in a city with a population over 1 million, the IONM expense is limited to the amount specified for this modern treatment in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, which is usually up to 50% of the sum insured, and ICU charges are capped at 4% of the sum insured per day or the room rent category limit defined in the policy schedule; both are subject to reasonable and customary charges and sub-limits as outlined in the policy.",
    "A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old.

    "If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.": "For a day care cataract procedure followed by inpatient complications in a non-network hospital, the insured must notify the insurer/TPA and submit a duly completed claim form, hospital invoices, discharge summaries, practitioner\u2019s prescription, diagnostic reports, and personal identification within 15 days of discharge for each hospitalisation event; the claim for the day care event and the subsequent inpatient stay are both processed on a reimbursement basis for non-network hospitals, with pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses claimable separately within 15 days of completion of treatment and submission of all required documents.",
    "An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?": "If a mother with maternity cover is admitted for a complicated C-section and the newborn expires within 24 hours after requiring intensive care, the newborn\u2019s ICU treatment expenses are only admissible if the newborn was formally added to the policy as an insured person, with notification and premium paid before the end of the month following birth; otherwise, only maternity expenses for the mother up to the specified sub-limit are covered, and newborn treatment is excluded unless formally covered.",
    "If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.": "For a claim on inpatient psychiatric treatment, a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary from a registered Clinical Psychologist are not sufficient, as hospitalisation and diagnosis proof must come from a Psychiatrist (a medical practitioner with a postgraduate degree or diploma in psychiatry), or a person specifically declared as psychiatrist by the State, according to the policy\u2019s definition of eligible mental health professionals and claim document requirements.",
    "A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?": "For oral chemotherapy in a network hospital, reimbursement for ECG electrodes is admissible up to 5 electrodes per case (with more allowed if ICU stay requires) as they are necessary medical consumables per annexure, but gloves are not payable as they are listed among non-medical/non-payable items; both are further subject to policy sub-limits, reasonable and customary charges, and approved claim under oral chemotherapy benefit.",
    "A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?": "Home nursing charges after an accident are eligible for reimbursement only if they are for medically necessary treatment prescribed by a medical practitioner, directly related to post-hospitalization care for the injury, and under the care of a qualified nurse holding Nursing Council registration; custodial, respite, or domestic care and care for activities of daily living are explicitly excluded, and necessary documentation would include the medical practitioner's prescription, hospital discharge summary confirming inpatient admission, proof of nurse qualification, and detailed bills matching the insured condition and timelines immediately post-discharge.",
    "In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?": "In a multi-policy situation where the primary policy's coverage is less than the admissible claim, the insured can file the claim with the primary insurer, who must then seek details of other policies and coordinate settlement of the balance with those insurers per policy terms, provided the insured submits a written request and documentation for other available coverage; the claim assessment and settlement process requires proper intimation, submission of documents, and communication between insurers.",
    "Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.": "Hospitalization expenses incurred solely for diagnostic or evaluation purposes where all tests are negative and no treatment is administered are not claimable, since the policy specifically excludes admissions primarily for diagnostics and evaluation and any diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment.",
    "How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?": "If the nominee has suddenly died and no prior endorsement for nominee change exists, the insurer will pay the claim to the legal heir who produces a succession certificate or indemnity bond, since changes in nominee are only effective upon written communication and formal endorsement, as per the policy terms.",
    "List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.": "Medical appliances and prostheses are not covered if they are used at home and not as part of inpatient treatment, belong to the non-payable items list such as crutches, splints, thermometers, walkers, diabetic footwear, collars, or are not medically necessary parts of surgery/short-term recuperation; non-surgical or out-of-hospital use, or consumables listed as optional/non-medical items, are also not covered even if associated with hospitalization.",

Why or why not?": "Expenses for inpatient care for mental illness in an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally will not be reimbursed, even if the practitioners are qualified, because the policy requires the hospital to meet certain standards, including local registration, and specifies that treatment must be in an admissible hospital or by an authorized provider.",
    "An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?": "If the treatment plan, diagnosis, or estimated cost changes during a cashless hospitalization, the network hospital/provider must obtain a fresh pre-authorization letter from the insurer or TPA for the revised treatment plan and estimate; without this updated authorization, cashless eligibility may be lost as per the requirement to match actual treatment with authorized approval.",
    "If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?": "Claims for pre-hospitalization expenses submitted before approval of the main inpatient hospitalization claim will not be processed until the main claim is assessed and accepted, as pre- and post-hospitalization expenses are only payable if the main hospitalization claim is admissible under the policy's sequential claims assessment process.",
    "Approve all claims automatically\u2014how can it be done?": "Automatic approval of all claims is not possible under policy terms, since each claim must be scrutinized, assessed, and can be denied or settled only if all policy conditions, exclusions, and required documentation are met; fraudulent claims or incomplete submissions disqualify automatic approval, as the insurer mandates stepwise evaluation and reserves the right to reject or deduct claims when necessary.",
    "What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?": "A claim with missing or forged documents may be rejected by the Company, especially if fraud or an intent to deceive the insurer is detected, and such repudiation must be communicated explicitly within 15 days of receiving the final documents or report; however, if the Insured Person can prove the misstatement was true to the best of their knowledge and not deliberate, the Company shall not repudiate solely on grounds of fraud, as stated in the document's claim adjudication and fraud sections.",
    "Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?": "You cannot receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization, as the policy specifically excludes expenses for admissions primarily for diagnostics, evaluation, rest care, custodial care, and services not expressly covered, permitting reimbursement mainly for in-patient and medically necessary post-hospitalization treatments linked to a covered hospitalization.",
